# GenAI-101

Welcome to **GenAI-101** – your ultimate guide to mastering **Generative AI** and **Agentic AI systems**! This repository is designed to document a comprehensive 90-day learning journey from foundational concepts to advanced applications, culminating in innovative projects that showcase the limitless possibilities of AI.

## 🚀 **Purpose**

This repository serves as:

1. **A Learning Roadmap**: A structured 90-day plan to gain expertise in Generative AI, NLP, transformers, and multimodal systems.
2. **A Resource Hub**: A curated collection of tutorials, projects, case studies, and tools.
3. **A Portfolio Showcase**: A home for completed projects, including real-world applications and capstone deliverables.

## 📖 **What You'll Find**

### **1. Phases of Learning**

This journey is divided into four distinct phases:

#### **Phase I: Foundational Understanding (Days 1–30)**

- Learn the basics of NLP, text preprocessing, and machine learning for text data.
- Explore key tools like `nltk`, `spaCy`, and Hugging Face.
- Hands-on projects: Sentiment analysis, spam detection, and rule-based chatbots.

#### **Phase II: Intermediate Skills and Model Training (Days 31–60)**

- Dive into advanced NLP models: transformers, fine-tuning, and generative models like GPT.
- Work on projects like domain-specific chatbots, text-to-image systems, and summarization tools.

#### **Phase III: Advanced Applications and System Design (Days 61–80)**

- Build scalable AI systems: multimodal applications, retrieval-augmented generation, and autonomous agents.
- Projects include conversational agents, multimodal search engines, and AI-powered analytics tools.

#### **Phase IV: Leadership and Innovation in Generative AI (Days 81–90)**

- Transition to thought leadership with projects integrating ethics, scalability, and advanced multimodal systems.
- Final capstone project: A comprehensive AI solution combining conversational, generative, and agentic capabilities.
