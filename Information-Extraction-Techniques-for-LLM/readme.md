In the world of Generative AI, we often talk about prompt engineering, model alignment, and retrieval systems but one foundational layer quietly makes all this possible: information extraction.  

We need to think about it. Every time an LLM answers a question about a legal document, summarizes a PDF report, or chats intelligently about what's on a website. Something had to first parse and prepare that raw data. Yet, many of us jump straight into model pipelines without deeply understanding the effort needed to make content “LLM-ready.”  

This week update is for those who realize that garbage in = garbage out still holds true, especially in the age of AI.  

Here onwards, we unpack the tools, libraries, and methods for extracting information from real-world formats like PDFs, Word files, web pages, and scanned documents. This isn’t just a tool roundup, this will be a guided walk through how these sources are handled in LLM frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langchain/) and [Docling](https://www.linkedin.com/company/docling/), and how to design pipelines that transform unstructured content into structured, chunked, enriched data flows.  

If you’re working on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enterprise Q&A, agentic assistants, or LLM-integrated workflows, probably these future updates will equips you to build the bridge between raw content and intelligent reasoning.  

Because the truth is the smarter an extraction pipeline, the smarter your LLM becomes.
